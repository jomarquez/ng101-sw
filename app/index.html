The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes.

What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her.

Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die?  </p>

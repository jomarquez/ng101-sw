## ng-101 sw edition
Thank you to [@start-angular](https://github.com/start-angular)'s [ani-theme] (https://github.com/start-angular/ani-theme) which is the base of this application. I updated to use a Folders-By-Feature directory structure and the angular-route library.

## Installation
1. Clone this angular 1.3 project
- `git clone https://github.com/jomarquez/ng101-sw.git
2. Make sure you have [bower](http://bower.io/), [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) and  [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed globally
3. On the command prompt run the following commands
